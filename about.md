My interest and curiosity for the field of data science started during my first job at a data analytics start-up in New Delhi. My interest drove me towards participating in data science competitions on Kaggle as a hobby. During this process I leveraged various resources available online and offline to teach myself different tricks and tools of the trade. I started off working with relational databases and ETL programming (Extract, Transform, Load) and as my requirements and necessities grew I leveraged other technologies such as Hadoop, Hbase, Pig, Hive and Spark.

I currently work as a Data Scientist at a mobile app analytics start-up called [rocQ Analytics](https://www.rocq.io). At rocQ analytics I develop features/products using Hadoop, Hbase, Parquet and Spark to draw insights by processing terabytes of data. My latest stint involves applying the skills I've learnt at rocQ to products revolving around the Internet of Things (IoT), especially the wearable segment of the industry. Having worked for so long in start-ups has embellished my 'get stuff done' skills in the best possible way and least possible time. 

After 2.5 years of doing data engineering and analysis in start-ups, I feel it's time to hone my skills further and pursue higher education in data science and analytics. I have a keen eye for Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining and Predictive Analytics in particular. I love exchanging ideas, crazy or simple, and will always seek this same characteristic in all places, careers and people.
